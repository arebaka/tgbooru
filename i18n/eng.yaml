        Hello, I am {name}! I cat store your pictures, GIF and video by tags without the limit on the quantity and send them via inline requests.
        To add a media to your booru, reply to it in PM or in any group with a command /add with a list of tags separated by space.
        To remove the media from your booru, reply to it with a command /delete.
        To display some information about the media, reply to it with a command /info.
        Finally, to see all commands, send /help
        Simple as that. I strongly advise against storing your real photos and other person's nudes here. Message @arelive about all bugs and issues.
